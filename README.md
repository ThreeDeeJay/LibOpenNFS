# LibOpenNFS 

Reverse engineered asset loaders (tracks, cars, images, music etc) for NFS 1-6 PC and PSX (with the possibility for other systems as well) for the creation of mod tools/converters through a (un)stable API

## Current Loadable Assets

Below is a table better describing the current level of asset load into LibOpenNFS:

| Game     | Cars | Tracks | Music |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| NFS6 PC  |      |        |       |
| NFS5 PC  | 40%**| 25%**  |       |
| NFS4 PC  | 90%* | 90%*   |       |
| NFS4 PS1 | 50%* |        |       |
| NFS3 PC  | 100% | 100%   | 95%   |
| NFS3 PS1 | 40%  | 90%    | 95%   |
| NFS2 SE  | 90%* | 90%    |       |
| NFS2 PC  | 90%* | 90%    |       |
| NFS2 PS1 | 90%* | 90%    |       |
| NFS1     |      |        |       |

\*Some titles fail to load in current builds of LibOpenNFS due to the undertaking of a large parser refactor. 

\*\*[NFS5 Track formats](https://github.com/OpenNFS/OpenNFS/issues/29) have been reverse engineered, but a stable parser has not yet been written.
